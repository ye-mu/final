This is an APP to share your comments about a restaurant. 
It's nothing new as there's slready plenty of mature APPs like Yelp doing the same thing.
However, there are still two reasons for me to choose this application
First, it seems Yelp is losing its shares to Google on restaurant recommendation. It is possible for Yelp to win back if it could be more professional and keep improving user experience
Second, I love eating, and I do enjoy the process of making an MVP Yelp.
As we only need to submit the url while we are required to follow the MVP development process, here are my:
Wireframes: design a APP for people to share their thoughts on restaurants, enabling them to view others; recommendation and login easily
User Stories: as a gourmet, I'd like to choose the best restaurants and share my thoughts to help others identify the best places to eat
Domain Model: as is shown in createdb.rb
Thanks so much for the wonderful course. This is the best in my last semester in Kellogg.
